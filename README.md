Android app that models a bullet journal for tracking your daily mood.

For each calendar date, record your mood and a short description of that day (optional). The color of the date will correspond to the mood selected, giving you a simple visualization of each month.

Note: The default color palette is

* Terrible = blue
* Bad = green
* Okay = yellow
* Good = orange
* Great = red 

You can change the color palette in the app settings.
